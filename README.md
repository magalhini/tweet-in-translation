# Tweet in Translation

Tweet In Translation, or @linguarit on Twitter, is a Twitter bot that tweets random French and German translations of useful day to day sentences.
The translations are converted into an image file so it becomes easier to read, and not limited by Twitter's character limit.

## Install it locally

You'll need your own Twitter app key, and write down all the secrets on an `.env` file in the project root. Then:

`npm install && npm run dev`
